# Deep-Q-Network
Training a Deep Neural Network for Reinforcement Learning task of Cartpole balancing (OpenAI gym environment)

<h2>What I learned:</h2>

- <b>Application of the following Python libraries/packages/API:
  1. Numpy
  2. Matplotlib
  3. Pytorch
  4. Open AI gym

- <b>Implementation of Pytorch NN as a Value function approximator for large MDPs
- <b>Advantage od Experience replay to break high correlation between similar trajectories and neighboring data points. Here replay buffers are implemented to reuse samples of old episodes.
- <b>Plotting Reward vs epoch for illustrating the Learning process of the Deep-Q-Network.
